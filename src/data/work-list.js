This custom bundle experience works through Shopify product metafields which holds the products included in a bundle and then displays them on the PDP by combining their color options together in such a way that customers can create their own bundles. This system is completely dynamic where UI elements, such as price, are updated based on quantity. Customers can also switch between packs and single products as well. Bundle discouning is implemented through Shopify discount function.',
